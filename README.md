### Hi there 👋


**lucasampaiox/lucasampaiox** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

🚀 Skills in python, tailwind, html, javascript 
🌱 Learning and practicing TensorFlow, OpenCV ...
🎯 Studying Unity, godot and deeping in the above technologies 
🌐 Trying to improve English and Norwegian 
⚡ I have a deep appreciation for Scandinavian culture, and I am particularly enamored with fjords and their breathtaking beauty
